I missed the day in class (Tuesday) when we talked about this, so
Tierney helped me with it during study group sesh.

So we apply (Lamda_xy.xyF) to TT, TF, FT, FF
this gives us:

TTF, TFF, FTF, FFF.

Substituting in the first value for either T or F

(Lambda_xy.x)TF = T
(Lambda_xy.x)FF = F
(Lambda_xy.y)TF = F
(Lambda_xy.y)FF = F

which checks out... as does this same method on the OR function.
